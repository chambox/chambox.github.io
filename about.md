Currently, I am a data scientist at [Yields.io](https://www.yields.io/). 

[My CV](https://github.com/chambox/chambox.github.io/blob/master/Curriculum_Vitae__Main_v1.pdf). 


I am passionate about a lot of interesting technologies, unfortunately there are only 24 hours in a day. With the constraint of time, I have chosen to focus on few things:
* Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning
* Blockchain, digital currencies, and their connection to  AI
* Finance and its connection to AI 

I work by a simple principle, "understand concepts and explain them even clearer".

Besides AI, I like eating quality food (I hate cooking though). My bosom friend and I  have created a community-driven platform that links hungry African food lovers to excellent home cooks.
If you interesting in the Afro cuisine, visit us [here](https://afroeat.be/).

What keeps me going is my precious three-year-old mini-me who challenges me in many ways. Unlike AI models that need millions of pictures to make a correct identification, my son only needs to see a picture of a family member once and recognizes them correctly in all subsequent pictures.   He is bright and learns faster than any AI (I am kidding, he is incomparable)
