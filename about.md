Currently, I am a data scientist at [Yields.io](https://github.com/chambox/chambox.github.io/blob/master/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). 

[My CV](https://www.yields.io/). 


I am passionate about a lot of interesting technologies, however, there are only 24 hours in a day. With the constraint of time, I have chosen to focus on few things:
* Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning
* Blockchain, digital currencies, and their connection to  AI
* Finance and its connection to AI 

I work by a simple principle, "understand concepts and explain them even clearer".

Besides AI, I like eating good food (I hate cooking though), my good friend and I  have created a social platform linking hungry African food lovers to excellent home cooks.
If you want to know more about good food of African origin, visit us [here](https://afroeat.be/).

What keeps me going is my little three-year-old who challenges me in many ways. Unlike AI models that need millions of pictures to make a correct identification, my son only needs to see a picture of a family member once and accurately recognize them in all subsequent pictures.   He is smart and learns faster than any AI, I am kidding,  I will not compare my son to AI.
