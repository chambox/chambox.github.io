I.e., the data was collected by recording or measuring the variabe of interest without influencing the subjects produces the data. \n",

In other words, we can only draw conclusions like, there is a strong correlation between variable A (independent variable) and B (dependent variable) when we analyse data from an observational study. \n",

    "Conclusions about causation can only be drawn from carefully designed experiments, i.e.,that a unit change of the independent variable  causes the response variable to change by $x$ units. "
